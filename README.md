# MIMIC-IV ICU Risk Analytics

Healthcare analytics and ICU risk analysis project using real-world MIMIC-IV clinical data, SQL, Python, SQLite, and healthcare KPI reporting.

---

## Project Overview

This project analyzes real-world ICU and hospital admissions data from the MIMIC-IV clinical database.

The project demonstrates:

* Healthcare analytics
* ICU KPI monitoring
* Mortality analysis
* Clinical SQL analytics
* Healthcare data engineering
* Python exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* Healthcare data visualization
* Healthcare business intelligence reporting

---

## Project Highlights

✔ Analysis of real-world MIMIC-IV clinical data

✔ ICU mortality analytics

✔ Length-of-stay (LOS) analysis

✔ Healthcare KPI reporting

✔ SQL-based clinical analytics

✔ Python exploratory data analysis

✔ Clinical data visualization

✔ Reproducible healthcare analytics workflow

## Main Findings

### Mortality varies substantially across ICU units

Mortality analysis identified meaningful differences between ICU departments, highlighting potential variation in patient severity and clinical outcomes.

### Longer ICU stays are associated with increased mortality

Longer ICU stays were associated with higher observed mortality rates in the analyzed cohort.

### A small number of diagnoses account for a large proportion of ICU admissions

Diagnosis frequency analysis identified major clinical categories driving ICU resource utilization.

## Key Clinical Insights

### ICU Mortality Analysis

Longer ICU stays were associated with higher observed mortality rates in the analyzed cohort.

### ICU Unit Performance

Coronary Care Units (CCU) and Neuro Surgical ICU units showed the highest mortality rates among analyzed ICU departments.

### Hospital Utilization Trends

ICU stay distribution analysis identified variability in resource utilization and patient severity across care units.

### Diagnosis Analysis

Top diagnosis categories represented the majority of ICU admissions, highlighting potential areas for operational optimization and risk monitoring.

## SQL Analytics Examples

### Overall Mortality Analysis

```sql
SELECT
    COUNT(*) AS total_admissions,
    SUM(hospital_expire_flag) AS total_deaths,
    ROUND(100.0 * SUM(hospital_expire_flag) / COUNT(*), 2) AS mortality_rate_percent
FROM admissions;
```

### ICU Unit Mortality Analysis

```sql
SELECT
    i.first_careunit,
    COUNT(*) AS total_icu_stays,
    SUM(a.hospital_expire_flag) AS total_deaths,
    ROUND(100.0 * SUM(a.hospital_expire_flag) / COUNT(*), 2) AS mortality_rate_percent
FROM icustays i
JOIN admissions a
    ON i.hadm_id = a.hadm_id
GROUP BY i.first_careunit
ORDER BY mortality_rate_percent DESC;
```

### Top Diagnoses Analysis

```sql
SELECT
    d.icd_code,
    COUNT(*) AS diagnosis_count
FROM diagnoses_icd d
JOIN icustays i
    ON d.hadm_id = i.hadm_id
GROUP BY d.icd_code
ORDER BY diagnosis_count DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
